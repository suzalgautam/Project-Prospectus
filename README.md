Analyzing Sentiment in Social Media During Major Political Events
Project Prospectus: Analyzing Sentiment in Social Media During Major Political Events
Project Overview
The project aims to analyze sentiment on social media during major political events using Python. The primary focus will be on Twitter data, given its widespread use for real-time reactions and discussions. This analysis will leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify sentiment trends and their correlation with political events. The project will be divided into several key tasks, including data collection, data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and visualization of the results.
Objectives
Data Collection: Collect tweets related to specific political events using Twitter's API. This will involve setting up authentication, filtering tweets by relevant hashtags or keywords, and storing the data for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Preprocess the collected tweets by removing duplicates, retweets, and irrelevant information. This step ensures that the dataset is accurate and manageable.
Sentiment Analysis: Apply NLP techniques to classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. This will involve using libraries like TextBlob, VADER, or more advanced models like BERT.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate sentiment trends over time and highlight any significant changes in public opinion during political events. Tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly will be utilized for this purpose.
Scope and Scale
The project will focus on a few major political events within a defined timeframe, such as presidential debates, election results announcements, or significant policy changes. This limitation ensures that the project remains feasible within the six-week course while providing meaningful insights.
Week-by-Week Plan
Week 1: Introduction to the project and setup. Learn how to use Twitter's API to collect data. Start collecting data for selected political events.
Week 2: Data cleaning and preprocessing. This includes removing noise from the dataset and ensuring the data is ready for analysis.
Week 3: Introduction to NLP and sentiment analysis techniques. Apply basic sentiment analysis using TextBlob and VADER.
Week 4: Explore advanced NLP techniques and models like BERT for more accurate sentiment classification.
Week 5: Data visualization. Learn how to create effective visualizations to represent sentiment trends.
Week 6: Finalize the project. Compile results, refine visualizations, and prepare a presentation of the findings.
Data and Tools
Data: Tweets collected using Twitter's API, focusing on specific hashtags or keywords related to political events.
Libraries and Tools:
Data Collection: Tweepy
Data Cleaning: Pandas
Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob, VADER, BERT (Hugging Face Transformers)

Learning Outcomes
By the end of the project, students will have gained experience in:
Using APIs to collect real-time data
Cleaning and preprocessing large datasets
Applying NLP techniques for sentiment analysis
Creating data visualizations to communicate findings effectively
Understanding the impact of political events on public sentiment as expressed through social media
Feasibility
The project is designed to be manageable within a six-week introductory Python course. Each week's tasks are structured to build on the previous week's work, ensuring a progressive learning curve. The use of well-documented libraries and tools will facilitate the learning process and help students achieve the project objectives.
Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive introduction to data analysis and NLP using Python, with a specific focus on sentiment analysis of social media data during political events. It combines practical skills in data handling, analysis, and visualization, providing a robust foundation for further studies in data science and machine learning.
