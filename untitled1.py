## Abstract

This project aims to analyze sentiment on social media during major political events using Python. The focus is on Twitter data,
leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify sentiment trends and their correlation with political events.
Key tasks include data collection, data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and visualization of results. By examining tweets related to
specific political events, this project seeks to uncover patterns in public opinion and how they shift during these events. The project
utilizes libraries such as Tweepy for data collection, Pandas for data cleaning, TextBlob and VADER for sentiment analysis, and Matplotlib
and Seaborn for visualization.
